# Arithmetic Formatter
Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve.

For example: 
```
  235
+  52
-----
```

So I created a function which receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function will optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.

Example:
```
  32         1      9999      523
+  8    - 3801    + 9999    -  49
----    ------    ------    -----
  40     -3800     19998      474
```
